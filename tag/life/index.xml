      <title>The Contemporary Overthinking Problem</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the following lockdowns and stay &amp;amp; work from home situations, the concept of Overthinking has gained popularity. Moreover, now and then, I find the gen-z people (and even me sometimes) replying to “What you doing?” texts with “Overthinking.” Surprisingly, I have seen people setting their social profiles’ status as Overthinking. It made me wonder if we have started treating overthinking as a clichéd concept that might overshadow the problems that the actual overthinking state brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will explain my opinion about overthinking and why it is becoming more cliché than a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do self-help books really help?</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/self_help_books/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, so this is going to be quite a short entry. A few days back, a friend of mine and I were talking about books. We were discussing the books that we have read. Well, she’s smart, so she was listing out great books like 1984, A Man Called Ove, etc. I told her how I had read quite a few of the “self-help” books during the last year or so (well, pandemic time, so needed some motivation, I guess :3). Then she asked me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do self-help books really help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>The Priority Hierarchy Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/priority/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t a well-planned blog. I just wanted to write something up, and this idea popped into my head while guessing the mid-term&amp;rsquo;s syllabus with one of my friends. It got me wondering about the importance that I give to these college exams is even lesser than writing a random blog even when my exams are less than a week away xD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One Year of Traversing the “eˣ” Graph</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/one_year_at_iitr/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! So you must be wondering, “What the hell is e ˣ doing in the title? It must be a scientific article!” Well, to put your mind at ease, this is not an article about the hidden beauty of e ˣ (although that would be an excellent one :P). Instead, it is about a now sophomore’s year of life at IITR. Please allow me to take you to a flashback journey through time!&lt;/p&gt;
