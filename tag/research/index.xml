      <title>Ascending the Research Trail</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, I shared my experience as a rookie undergrad researcher in a previous blog: &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/vlgiitr/riding-the-noisy-research-track-4035e64e7ea8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Riding the Noisy Research Track&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, I have grown from a rookie researcher into a more mature beginner researcher with a better outlook on the bigger picture in research (thinking beyond publishing a paper) owing to my close collaboration with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shi-labs.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SHI Labs&lt;/a&gt; in the last couple of years. I have had several realizations that I will be sharing through this article. A few of those to get your interest piqued are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤔 I went from &amp;ldquo;Ph.D., Me? Nooooooo&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;I primarily applied to Ph.D. programs for grad school.&amp;rdquo; What changed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💭 Is publishing/releasing a paper a good &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo; for research?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📖 Is open-source in A.I. a boon or a bane?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🎗 What is the importance of the advisor and collaborators?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⚓️ How vital is the authenticity of research?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Summer Diaries: Intern Diary of an Undergrad DL Researcher</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/summer_diary_wo/</link>

      <guid>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/summer_diary_wo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer, I worked as a remote research intern at SHI Lab @ University of Oregon (UO) and Picsart AI Research (PAIR). I joined the SHI Lab to work with Professor Humphrey Shi in November 2020 during my second year and continued my work there during the summers, and I joined PAIR during the summers (June 2021). My research focused on the field of Computer Vision during both my internships.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Riding the Noisy Research Track</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, people! This article will share my experience and learnings during the last eight months as an undergrad researcher. For those reading one of my blogs for the first time, I am a CSE undergrad (about to enter 3rd year) and am working as a Research Intern at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humphreyshi.com/people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SHI Lab @ UO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://picsart.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Picsart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before we dive in, let me clear it out that I have probably had a more intense research experience for better or worse than some of the other undergrad people at IITR. So, don’t make any judgments about research based on the content in this post 😛. So, we got that sorted out. Let’s begin!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Research if I can Develop?!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! Alright, so it has been more than 3 months since my last blog, where I described how a CSE student’s life at IITR is being turned into a living hell by the system and professors. Sadly, the going has only got more challenging, with profs imposing more of their ingenious will on students. I recently had my ETEs, so I am brimming with academic frustration and will probably end up writing another blog, but that’s a topic for another day :P&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Curse of Dimensionality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself stuck in the middle of a problem having a large number of dimensions? You keep on trying harder and harder to come up with a solution that would satisfy all the dimensions of the problem. Still, every time one or another dimension makes ur efforts look futile! It turns out that you can solve a problem very efficiently when presented with not more than 2 or 3 dimensions. Nevertheless, this world is not kind to us every time! You might find yourself struggling amidst a problem, thinking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
