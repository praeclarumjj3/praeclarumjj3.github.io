      <title>Riding the Noisy Research Track</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, people! This article will share my experience and learnings during the last eight months as an undergrad researcher. For those reading one of my blogs for the first time, I am a CSE undergrad (about to enter 3rd year) and am working as a Research Intern at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humphreyshi.com/people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SHI Lab @ UO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://picsart.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Picsart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before we dive in, let me clear it out that I have probably had a more intense research experience for better or worse than some of the other undergrad people at IITR. So, donâ€™t make any judgments about research based on the content in this post ðŸ˜›. So, we got that sorted out. Letâ€™s begin!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Research if I can Develop?!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! Alright, so it has been more than 3 months since my last blog, where I described how a CSE studentâ€™s life at IITR is being turned into a living hell by the system and professors. Sadly, the going has only got more challenging, with profs imposing more of their ingenious will on students. I recently had my ETEs, so I am brimming with academic frustration and will probably end up writing another blog, but thatâ€™s a topic for another day :P&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself stuck in the middle of a problem having a large number of dimensions? You keep on trying harder and harder to come up with a solution that would satisfy all the dimensions of the problem. Still, every time one or another dimension makes ur efforts look futile! It turns out that you can solve a problem very efficiently when presented with not more than 2 or 3 dimensions. Nevertheless, this world is not kind to us every time! You might find yourself struggling amidst a problem, thinking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
