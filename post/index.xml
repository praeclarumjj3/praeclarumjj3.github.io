      <title>Staying Sane Amidst the Insane Madness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, since my last post ( where I described 1 year of my life as an IITR freshman), a lot has happened. The online semester started, I submitted my first paper to a Top Tier Conference, and‚Ä¶.basically, that‚Äôs it üòõ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an IITian (or one of the IITR junta more specifically), you might have got the impression about this post‚Äôs theme. Yes indeed! This article describes the wreckage caused by the online semester and the evil professors or the system in our lives and how to cope with that. I will try to keep it short. Although there is just so much wrong with the online system, it would be damn hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! So you must be wondering, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is e À£ doing in the title? It must be a scientific article!‚Äù Well, to put your mind at ease, this is not an article about the hidden beauty of e À£ (although that would be an excellent one :P). Instead, it is about a now sophomore‚Äôs year of life at IITR. Please allow me to take you to a flashback journey through time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself stuck in the middle of a problem having a large number of dimensions? You keep on trying harder and harder to come up with a solution that would satisfy all the dimensions of the problem. Still, every time one or another dimension makes ur efforts look futile! It turns out that you can solve a problem very efficiently when presented with not more than 2 or 3 dimensions. Nevertheless, this world is not kind to us every time!
