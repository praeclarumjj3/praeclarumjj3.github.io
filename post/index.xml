      <title>Why Research if I can Develop?!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! Alright, so it has been more than 3 months since my last blog, where I described how a CSE student’s life at IITR is being turned into a living hell by the system and professors. Sadly, the going has only got more challenging, with profs imposing more of their ingenious will on students. I recently had my ETEs, so I am brimming with academic frustration and will probably end up writing another blog, but that’s a topic for another day :P&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! So you must be wondering, “What the hell is e ˣ doing in the title? It must be a scientific article!” Well, to put your mind at ease, this is not an article about the hidden beauty of e ˣ (although that would be an excellent one :P). Instead, it is about a now sophomore’s year of life at IITR. Please allow me to take you to a flashback journey through time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself stuck in the middle of a problem having a large number of dimensions? You keep on trying harder and harder to come up with a solution that would satisfy all the dimensions of the problem. Still, every time one or another dimension makes ur efforts look futile! It turns out that you can solve a problem very efficiently when presented with not more than 2 or 3 dimensions. Nevertheless, this world is not kind to us every time!
