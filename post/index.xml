      <title>Summer Diaries: Intern Diary of an Undergrad DL Researcher</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/summer_diary_wo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This summer, I worked as a remote research intern at SHI Lab @ University of Oregon (UO) and Picsart AI Research (PAIR). I joined the SHI Lab to work with Professor Humphrey Shi in November 2020 during my second year and continued my work there during the summers, and I joined PAIR during the summers (June 2021). My research focused on the field of Computer Vision during both my internships.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Contemporary Overthinking Problem</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/overthinking/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the following lockdowns and stay &amp;amp; work from home situations, the concept of Overthinking has gained popularity. Moreover, now and then, I find the gen-z people (and even me sometimes) replying to ‚ÄúWhat you doing?‚Äù texts with ‚ÄúOverthinking.‚Äù Surprisingly, I have seen people setting their social profiles‚Äô status as Overthinking. It made me wonder if we have started treating overthinking as a clich√©d concept that might overshadow the problems that the actual overthinking state brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article will explain my opinion about overthinking and why it is becoming more clich√© than a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Riding the Noisy Research Track</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/research_ride/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, people! This article will share my experience and learnings during the last eight months as an undergrad researcher. For those reading one of my blogs for the first time, I am a CSE undergrad (about to enter 3rd year) and am working as a Research Intern at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humphreyshi.com/people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SHI Lab @ UO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://picsart.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Picsart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before we dive in, let me clear it out that I have probably had a more intense research experience for better or worse than some of the other undergrad people at IITR. So, don‚Äôt make any judgments about research based on the content in this post üòõ. So, we got that sorted out. Let‚Äôs begin!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do self-help books really help?</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/self_help_books/</link>

      <guid>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/self_help_books/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, so this is going to be quite a short entry. A few days back, a friend of mine and I were talking about books. We were discussing the books that we have read. Well, she‚Äôs smart, so she was listing out great books like 1984, A Man Called Ove, etc. I told her how I had read quite a few of the ‚Äúself-help‚Äù books during the last year or so (well, pandemic time, so needed some motivation, I guess :3). Then she asked me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do self-help books really help?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Priority Hierarchy Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/priority/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t a well-planned blog. I just wanted to write something up, and this idea popped into my head while guessing the mid-term&amp;rsquo;s syllabus with one of my friends. It got me wondering about the importance that I give to these college exams is even lesser than writing a random blog even when my exams are less than a week away xD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Research if I can Develop?!</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/why_research/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! Alright, so it has been more than 3 months since my last blog, where I described how a CSE student‚Äôs life at IITR is being turned into a living hell by the system and professors. Sadly, the going has only got more challenging, with profs imposing more of their ingenious will on students. I recently had my ETEs, so I am brimming with academic frustration and will probably end up writing another blog, but that‚Äôs a topic for another day :P&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! So you must be wondering, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is e À£ doing in the title? It must be a scientific article!‚Äù Well, to put your mind at ease, this is not an article about the hidden beauty of e À£ (although that would be an excellent one :P). Instead, it is about a now sophomore‚Äôs year of life at IITR. Please allow me to take you to a flashback journey through time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Curse of Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/curse_dimension/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself stuck in the middle of a problem having a large number of dimensions? You keep on trying harder and harder to come up with a solution that would satisfy all the dimensions of the problem. Still, every time one or another dimension makes ur efforts look futile! It turns out that you can solve a problem very efficiently when presented with not more than 2 or 3 dimensions. Nevertheless, this world is not kind to us every time! You might find yourself struggling amidst a problem, thinking&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
