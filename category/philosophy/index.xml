      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, so this is going to be quite a short entry. A few days back, a friend of mine and I were talking about books. We were discussing the books that we have read. Well, she’s smart, so she was listing out great books like 1984, A Man Called Ove, etc. I told her how I had read quite a few of the “self-help” books during the last year or so (well, pandemic time, so needed some motivation, I guess :3). Then she asked me:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Right, so this isn&amp;rsquo;t a well-planned blog. I just wanted to write something up, and this idea popped into my head while guessing the mid-term&amp;rsquo;s syllabus with one of my friends. It got me wondering about the importance that I give to these college exams is even lesser than writing a random blog even when my exams are less than a week away xD.&lt;/p&gt;
