      <title>Riding the Noisy Research Track</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, people! This article will share my experience and learnings during the last eight months as an undergrad researcher. For those reading one of my blogs for the first time, I am a CSE undergrad (about to enter 3rd year) and am working as a Research Intern at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humphreyshi.com/people&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SHI Lab @ UO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://picsart.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Picsart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before we dive in, let me clear it out that I have probably had a more intense research experience for better or worse than some of the other undergrad people at IITR. So, don‚Äôt make any judgments about research based on the content in this post üòõ. So, we got that sorted out. Let‚Äôs begin!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Research if I can Develop?!</title>
      <link>https://praeclarumjj3.github.io/post/why_research/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! Alright, so it has been more than 3 months since my last blog, where I described how a CSE student‚Äôs life at IITR is being turned into a living hell by the system and professors. Sadly, the going has only got more challenging, with profs imposing more of their ingenious will on students. I recently had my ETEs, so I am brimming with academic frustration and will probably end up writing another blog, but that‚Äôs a topic for another day :P&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! So you must be wondering, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is e À£ doing in the title? It must be a scientific article!‚Äù Well, to put your mind at ease, this is not an article about the hidden beauty of e À£ (although that would be an excellent one :P). Instead, it is about a now sophomore‚Äôs year of life at IITR. Please allow me to take you to a flashback journey through time!&lt;/p&gt;
